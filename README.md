# CSharpPractice
just some nonsense, nothing to see here

### command line start
dotnet new console -o ./CsharpProjects/TestProject

### writing to console
int a = 42;
int b = 119;
int c = a + b;
Console.WriteLine(c);
Console.ReadKey();

### notes
+ select Run -> Run without debugging, to start up a web application easiest. console applications easily run with 
  + dotnet run --project ProjectNameHere
